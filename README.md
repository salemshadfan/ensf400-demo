## Summary

The demo consists of a simple web application along with a comprehensive suite of tests. Its goals include:
- **Cross-platform compatibility**
- **Simplicity and minimal system requirements**
- **Fast setup and execution**
- **High test coverage**  
- **Demonstration of multiple business domains and techniques**

Key techniques and features:
- **Unit Tests:** Using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with JUnit and Mockito.
- **UI Tests:** Employing Selenium, Cucumber, and Behave for both API and user interface testing.
- **Integration Tests:** Testing with the H2 database.
- **Database Versioning:** Handled by Flyway.
- **Static Analysis & Security:** Using OWASP DependencyCheck and SonarQube.
- **Hot-swap Code:** Enabled through Gretty.
- **Mutation Testing:** With Pitest.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Fully demonstrated using Jenkins.
